## About
This module is about the feedback a user can give regarding a suggested memory. The feedback
is given by the user via voice. This feedback is processed in the following way: 
1. The .wav feedback file is transformed to text via Automated-Speech-Recognition (ASR).
2. Sentiment Analysis is done on the text using a fined tuned model, that has GPT-3 as 
a backbone.
