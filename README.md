## Using a Recommender System for Reminiscence Threapy
Our system leaverages the power of one of the best language models today: GPT-3. We use GPT-3 to manage all interactions with the user, the system has a knowledge base where it keeps relevant and updated information of the user so it can make the right recommendations. These recommendations come in the form of events, songs, artists or films and have the goal of bringing back positive memories to the user and keeping its mind active through Reminiscence Therapy
